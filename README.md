## Animation

Blender runs at 24fps, therefore scenes 1-3 = 1056 frames, scene 4 = 480 frames

Can make characters hang staionary on certain scenes as dialogue occurs

## Sound

Needs narration and/or subtitles

I've created a basic narration which can be used to pace the scenes

## Environment

Using a 24x24 size baseplate, which will be projected upon a QR Code

The code will be place inside a Lego Frame, which will be made using a 32x32 size baseplate
